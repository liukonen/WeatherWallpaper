# WeatherWallpaper
Changes your wallpaper based on the weather conditions outside

# About
This was a project I wrote years ago. I had it working for a while, and then lost my source code. The original app only used weather, and pulled the data from Yahoo. The new verison will have multiple sources to pick from (in case one goes down), and have the ability to have different wallpapers also by time of day.
