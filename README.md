# WeatherWallpaper

WeatherWallpaper is an application that changes your wallpaper based on the weather conditions outside. It provides the ability to have different wallpapers depending on the time of day, and it checks for weather updates every hour.

## About

This project was initially developed years ago, and it recently went through an update. The original version only used Yahoo as the weather data source, but the new version supports multiple sources to ensure reliability. It also incorporates the feature of changing wallpapers based on the time of day.
